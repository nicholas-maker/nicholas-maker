Hello everyone! 😊

My name is Nicholas, and I’m 18 years old.
I currently live in Odesa, Ukraine. 🌊✨
I’m a first-year student at the International Humanitarian University, where I’m studying for a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunications and Radio Engineering (specialty 172). 📡🎓

Right now, I’m also learning Front-end Development, and in the future, I dream of working in this field! 💻✨
